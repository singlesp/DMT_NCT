    % this version uses the controlability gramian to quickly calculate
    % control energies and can only be used in scenarios where the identity
    % matrix is used as the control strategy. Often will be scaled from the
    % slower calculations, the amount of which depends on how the B matrix 
    %is constructed in those cases (with 1's or 2's along the diagonal)
    %Anorm - normalized adjacency matrix
    %T - time-horizon
    %TS - time-series overwhich to compute time-resolved control energy
    %TS should be size nparc x volumes

    % Preallocate matrices for speed
